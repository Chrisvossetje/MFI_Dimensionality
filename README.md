# MFI_Dimensionality

### Eigenlesions_Comparison.py
Implements the finding of basis, as defined in the paper, for the space of all lesions.
Provides methods to compress and decompress single lesions with respect to the above basis.

### intrinsic_dimension.py 
Implements nearest neighbour method.

### tensortensor.py 
Provides the implementation of t-SVD and all necessary functions.
Provides methods to display 2d or 3d np arrays using matplotlib.
Provides methods to generate a parameterised 3d guassian matrix.

### tensortensorerror.py
Provides the code with which we calculated the error of t-SVD truncation.

### SyntheticLesionToolbox.py
Code provided by Matrijn with which we can generate synthetic lesions.

### MockLesions/
Contains all mock lesions.
